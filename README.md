# Plugin Repository for KITModelViewer
[KITModelViewer](https://github.com/KIT-IAI/SDM_KITModelViewer) has a plugin mechanism that allows you to develop your own extensions.
Two plugins are already included in the download archive of the KITModelViewer. One is the very simple "Hello World" example that shows the basic functionality of the plugin API and how to use it to access the internal database. The second plugin provides a simple Python API and allows you to create your own Python scripts that will be executed directly within the KITModelViewer.

Here you will find the [Plugin Feature Doucumentation](Plugin_Features.md)
